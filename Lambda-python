#Lambda is a small anonymous function in Python. It doesn't need a name.
#syntax: lambda arguments : expression
# A lambda function can have any number of parameters, but only one expression.
#This ability of lambdas to be invoked immediately allows you to use them inside functions like map(), filter() and reduce()

#lambda in filter(): select some particular elements from a sequence of elements.
import numpy as np
import functools


list1 = np.arange(3,11)
print(list1)

evenlst = list(filter(lambda x : (x%2 == 0), list1))
print(evenlst)

#lambda in map(): apply a particular operation to every element in a sequence
maplst = list(map(lambda x : x + 5 , list1))
print(maplst)

#lambda in reduce() : apply an operation to every element in a sequence. However, it differs from the map in its working.
reducelst = functools.reduce(lambda x,y : x*y , list1)
print(reducelst)
